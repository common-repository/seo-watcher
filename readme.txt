Seo Watcher checks your daily Google rankings directly inside of Wordpress 


== Description ==

Briefly said, Seo Watcher checks your daily Google rankings directly inside of Wordpress.

More precisely, you may enter three website URLs and three keywords. Subsequently, Seo Watcher will check which of these sites are listed in Google's TOP 100. The plugin is installed inside of only a few seconds and delivers a wealth of useful information.
Quite simply.

The plugin works as follows: Seo Watcher connects to the Google server, as if it was a regular user and requests the 30 sites (at maximum). Then the data will be saved and incorporated. This explains the limitation on the amount of sites and keywords. If Seo Watcher would request considerably more sites, there might be negative consequences. (That is Google blocking the requesting IP.)

How did it come to this?
For some years now I've been dealing with Google rankings a lot and on a professional basis. To me this has meant, that the first thing to do in the morning, when I was entering my office was, apart from drinking coffee, to access Google and check the rankings.
Naturally, I became sick of it (to say the least) and such the first version of Seo Watcher cam into existence.
After some changes and experiences you are now holding the first public version in your hands.

Since there is a fair amount of time and effort put into Seo Watcher, any support is more than welcome. May it be donations, ideas, bug reports, suggestions or even critique.
